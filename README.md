This code is from a much dumber and stupid me. It is terrible, I know! I am making this open source in the hopes of someone improving on it.

This was originally a payware plugin for X-Plane 11, but abandoned a few months later, and now released as free and open-source software.

It is designed to commit actions based on voice commands, using PocketSphinx for voice recognition.
